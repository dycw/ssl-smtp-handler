# ssl-smtp-handler

A Python standard library logging handler which uses SMTP_SSL to send its mail

## Introduction

I wanted an easy way to send emails for my Python projects, with code that was
adapted for today's (2021) way of doing things. This `Handler` is designed for
use with the Python standard library.

Supports Python 3.6+; the currently (2021) supported versions of Python.
